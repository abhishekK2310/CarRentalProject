Car Rental System ðŸš—
This is a simple but complete command-line based Car Rental System built using Java. The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a functional and easy-to-use application for managing car rentals. It allows users to view available cars, rent a car for a specified number of days, and return a car.

Features
Rent a Car: Users can select from a list of available cars and rent one for a specified number of days.

Return a Car: Marks a rented car as available again for the next customer.

View Available Cars: The menu displays a real-time list of all cars currently available for rent.

Price Calculation: The total rental cost is automatically calculated and displayed to the user before they confirm the rental.

Simple Menu Interface: An interactive and easy-to-use console menu guides the user through the rental process.

Technologies Used
Language: Java

Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures (ArrayList)

Code Overview
The project is structured into several classes, each with a specific responsibility:

Car: Represents a car with attributes like carId, brand, model, basePricePerDay, and its availability status.

Customer: Represents a customer with a unique customerId and name.

Rental: Links a Car with a Customer and stores the rental duration in days.

CarRentalSystem: This is the main engine of the application. It manages the lists of cars, customers, and active rentals, and contains the core logic for renting and returning cars.

Main: The entry point of the application. It initializes the CarRentalSystem, adds some sample cars to the inventory, and starts the user menu.
